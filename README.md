# Tz Funding

Tz Funding is a crowdfunding descentralized application for Tezos blockchain.
It allows entrepreneurs to obtain financing from project proposals written in pdf documents.
Next, they are transformed into images and NTFs are created.
Investors who trust the project get non-fungible tokens that represent the investment made.
